svrtl is copy of files in the original riscv directory.
there are couple of manual changes:
1. i dont like "for (int ii=0"  where variables are defined on the spot. 
   regular verilog doesnt like it. it probably has no speed advantage.
   so i declare all "temporary" variables once and module level.

2. what was that?


to try it out:

1.  llbin/make_riscv.py   : this script runs the translation process.
    it fills  vlogs directory with files.

2. next cd to tb directory.
    ./compileAndSimulate  is the script.

    it uses python-verilog connectio.  You can get it from my git also.
    Or You can use your own testbench.

good luck.
